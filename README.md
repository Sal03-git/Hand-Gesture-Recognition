# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

This repository stores the source code for the hand gesture recognition model.
The original data consisted of numpy .npz files of different gestures and their corresponding images that was stored in 'data' subdirectory. The images were stored in other subdirectories within that data folder.

When the hand_gesture_reader file is executed, a webcam window opens which can predict four gestures. The program then activates once certain arrow keys that are mapped to certain gestures.
